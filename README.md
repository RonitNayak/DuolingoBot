# DuolingoBot

simple bot using pyautogui to complete duolingo lessons using image recognition

I had originally made this for Duolingo on desktop but I found out later that it doesn't give XP after a certain number of tries, so I used an Android Emulator and had the bot run on that

The images are simple screen snippets of text. It is important that if you wish to replicate this program that you take the pictures again on your own because they need to be pixel perfect for it to work

Here are the docs for pyautogui that i used for reference - https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
